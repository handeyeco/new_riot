# New Riot WordPress Theme

Working on building a minimalist WordPress theme for my blog.

Ideally New Riot will have subtle tones contrasting rich reds.

Bold lines will create a rigid, offset structure ideal for collapsing down to mobile.

It will utilize `excerpt` rather than `content` for concise introductions to blog posts.

Initial commit and "working" theme (i.e. `index.php` and `style.css`) along the `header.php` and `footer.php`.
